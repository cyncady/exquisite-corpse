# Excquisite Corpse San Francisco
## Chapter 1
It was a dark night. The fog had rolled in early, even for San Francisco.  Angela shivered in the center of Justin Herman plaza fumbling with her iPhone.  This was her third dot-dot-date meet up this week.  "Nick" said he'd meet her 5:30.  That was twenty minutes ago.   They'd only chatted on dot-dot-date a couple of times.  He'd said he worked at a undersea networking company with a bunch of sharks - it sounded funnier to her when he said it.

"cold, windy, damp.  Meet me in ferry building. brrr.", she texted as she crossed the plaza.
